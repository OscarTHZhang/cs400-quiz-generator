#### Notes or comments to grader
1. Open Main.java to run the application
2. In the adding test scene, after selecting the topic, click + to add the selected topic
3. In the quiz scene/session, PREVIOUS goes to the previous question, SUBMIT will submit the answer, and SKIP will go the the next question (user is not able to change the answer after he/she submits the answer)
4. "alert to save" functionality is a little duplicated than what we did. We have already provided a button for saving the question in the menu.
5. make and .jar is not working because it says it cannot find the symbol for json parser and we don't know why. so probably start the application from the Main.java
